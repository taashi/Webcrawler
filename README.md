# Webcrawler


How to make the code work :

Python Version to be installed - 3.6

This code was written on MAC. Please include r in the path when running on a Windows System
Install BeautifulSoup4 .

Give the path to store HTML's and the links that are scrapped by the webcrawler.

Task 1 a represents crawling using the BFS technique.
Task 1 b represents crawling using the DFS technique.
Task 2 is focussed crawling using the terms "lunar" and "moon"


In the Pycharm projects, make a project webcrawler.
Create a folder called lists where the text document for the BFS and DFS crawled list would be made. 
Now create another folder in webcrawler called html where the html files would be collected.
 Give these paths in the variables â€“ SCRAPPEDHTMLS for collecting the htmls and SCRAPPEDLINKS for creating the DFS or BFS text file in that folder.
BFS highest depth -3
DFS highest depth -6
